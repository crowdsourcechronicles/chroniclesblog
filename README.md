## Description

The motivation for this project was to create an open-source forum site where users can share a post and discuss with other users on various topics. We built this to practice and refine our skills with express, express-session, and sequelize to create an application with its own database and MVC structure. It solves the problem of giving people a place to post their thoughts and further discuss with others to learn and communicate. We learned a lot about how to use an MVC paradigm and connect via sequelize with other technologies we have learned.
